# SpaceWebs_Spectroscopy
This repository includes Python scripts and experimental data I used to evaluate a new-to-market spectral imager as a payload for net crawling bots on low gravity bodies. This repo isn't super well documented but potentially useful to anyone who read my paper on the subject. See http://resenv.media.mit.edu/SpaceWebs
